# GitHub Essentials

GitHub serves as a big library for your Git projects. It acts as a platform that aids in storing and managing your code online, making it simpler to collaborate with others and exhibit your work globally.

## What Makes GitHub Great? ✨

Here's why GitHub is impressive:

- 💾 **Remote Storage:** GitHub stores your projects on the internet, enabling you to access them from anywhere with an internet connection.

- 🤝 **Collaboration:** GitHub streamlines teamwork. You can invite friends to join your project, allowing everyone to work on the code together.

- 📝 **Issue Tracking:** GitHub comes with a built-in system for tracking problems and tasks. This ensures you won't forget what needs fixing or adding.

- 🔄 **Pull Requests:** Think of pull requests as a way to say, "Hey, can you check out my changes?" on GitHub. It simplifies the process of letting others see what you did and incorporate it into the project.

- 🌐 **GitHub Pages:** With GitHub, you can even create/host your static websites! It's an excellent way to showcase your work to a global audience.

- 🌟 **Codespaces:** GitHub offers a built-in online IDE that lets you write and test code directly on GitHub. And the best part? It's free to use!

- 👥 **Community and Social Features:** GitHub boasts a welcoming developer community. You can follow other developers, appreciate cool projects, and participate in discussions. It's like a bustling hangout spot for developers! 🎉

## Setting Up Git with GitHub 🛠️

Before diving deep into GitHub, let's connect our local Git setup with our GitHub account. This connection will allow us to push our local repositories.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one. If you already have an account and are logged in, you can skip this step. To create a new GitHub account, follow this [link](https://github.com/signup). 🆕

### Step 2: Authenticate Git with GitHub

To enable Git to communicate with your GitHub account, you need to authenticate this connection using an SSH key. This key serves as a secure identifier, allowing your computer to interact with GitHub without repeatedly entering your username and password. 🔐

First, let's check if you have an authentication key on your computer. If you see the message "No such file or directory" in your terminal, you don't have an SSH key, and you can proceed with the following steps to generate a new one. ❗

`ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

#### 2.1 Generate an SSH Key

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Settings."
3. In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys."
4. Click the green button in the top right corner that says "New SSH Key." Give your key a descriptive name (I usually type the name of my local machine, the computer on which I am going to set this up.) and set the key type to authentication. In the key section, paste your SSH Key. 🚀

To generate a new SSH key, follow these instructions:

   1. Open Git Bash by right-clicking on your desktop.
   2. Paste the provided command, replacing "yourEmailAddress" with your GitHub email address (the email you used to create your GitHub account).

        `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C yourEmailAddress`

        This command creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.

When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," you can press Enter to accept the default file location.

Next, it will promp you to type in a password. You can enter a password if you want, but it is not required. However, it's safer to have one, so we recommend creating a password when prompted.

Once the SSH key is generated, type the following command in your Git Bash terminal to check if everything was created correctly:

`ssh -T git@github.com`

This command attempts to SSH to GitHub. If everything went well, you will see a warning output like this:

> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
> ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.    
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Verify that the fingerprint shown in the message matches [GitHub's public keys fingerprint](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints). If it does, type "**yes**" and press Enter.

You will see an output similar to this with your username:

> Hi GITHUB_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

### Step 3: Adding Your SSH Key to GitHub

After generating the key, you'll be able to view and copy the public key. To do this, copy and paste the following command or type it in your Git Bash terminal:

`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

Highlight and copy the output, which starts with "ssh-ed25519" and ends with your email address.

>ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHMEFMS0fZmNUm4WgQx/KOpHSmPp5zgm3I3rk3tFy5 example@example.com


1. Go back to GitHub in your browser window, paste the copied key into the key field.
2. Click "Add SSH key." You've successfully added your SSH key! 🎉

You have now successfully generated and added your SSH key! Hoorayy!! 🎉

Once you've set up Git with GitHub, you can start managing your code more efficiently. Create, track, and collaborate on projects by creating Git repositories, making changes, pushing them to GitHub, and leveraging features like branching, pull requests, and continuous integration. Familiarize yourself with Git commands and best practices to streamline your development workflow
