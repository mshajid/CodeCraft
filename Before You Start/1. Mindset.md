### Rabbit Hole Syndrome
_Developers can sometimes get caught up in researching or investigating a particular problem, leading them to dig deeper and deeper without making any actual progress on their project. It's like digging deep without any value which leads to wasting your precious time._

## Tutorial Hell

"**Tutorial hell**" is when someone who's learning to code gets stuck always doing tutorials without getting better at coding on their own. They keep following instructions but struggle to create their own code. This can make them feel frustrated and unsure about their skills. It's like reading cooking recipes but never making your own dishes. It's important to practice coding by yourself to improve.
