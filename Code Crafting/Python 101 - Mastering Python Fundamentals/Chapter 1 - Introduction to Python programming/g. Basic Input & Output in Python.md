# Python User Input and Output: A Beginner's Guide

When you're just starting to learn Python, it's important to understand how you can ask users for information and display that information as output. In this tutorial, we're going to learn about the `input()` function, which lets you get information from users, and the `print()` function, which lets you show information to users. We'll use practical examples to make it easy to understand.

## Getting Information from Users with `input()`

Imagine the `input()` function as a way for your Python program to have a conversation with users. It's like a bridge that allows your program to ask questions and users to respond. You can use it to gather various types of information, such as names, numbers, or even special characters, and then store that information in a variable (a kind of storage container). Using `input()` is simple and can be added to your code easily.

### Example 1: Asking for the User's Name

Let's begin with a very basic example. We'll use the input() function to ask the user for their name and then store what they type in a variable.
