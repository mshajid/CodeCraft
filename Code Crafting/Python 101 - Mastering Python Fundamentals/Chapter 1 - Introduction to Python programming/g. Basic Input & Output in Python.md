# Basic Input & Output (I/O) Tutorial for Beginners

When you're just starting off with Python, it's important to learn how to ask users for information and display that information as output. In this tutorial, we will learn about printing output using the print() function, formatting output using f-strings and str.format(), taking input from the user using the input() function, and we will explore some real-life examples for better comprehension.

## Getting Users input()

Imagine the `input()` function as a way for your Python program to have a conversation with users. It's like a bridge that allows your program to ask questions and users to respond. You can use it to gather various types of information, such as names, numbers, or even special characters, and then store that information in a variable (a kind of storage container). Using `input()` is simple and can be added to your code easily.

### Example 1: Asking for the User's Name

Let's begin with a very basic example. We'll use the input() function to ask the user for their name and then store what they type in a variable. 

```python
X = input("What is your name? ")
```
