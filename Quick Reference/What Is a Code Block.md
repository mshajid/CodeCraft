# What is a Code Block?

A code block is a collection of instructions that belong together. Think of it like a recipe in a cookbookâ€”it's a set of steps to make a dish. In programming, we use code blocks to group actions that need to be done together.

We show code blocks in different ways depending on the programming language we're using. In some languages, we use curly braces `{}` around them. In others, like Python, we use spaces to line up the instructions.

## Why Are Code Blocks Important?

Code blocks help us in several ways:

### 1. Organization

They keep our code organized. Just like sections in a book, code blocks group similar instructions, making it easier to understand and work with.

### 2. Telling a Story

Imagine writing a story. Code blocks help us write the story of our program step by step. It's like saying, "First do this, then do that."

### 3. Avoiding Confusion

Code blocks keep things clear. They show when an action begins and ends, preventing confusion.

### 4. Reusing Code

We can reuse code blocks whenever we need the same set of actions. It's like having a recipe you can use in different dishes.

## Example in Python

In Python, we use spaces to create code blocks. Here's a simple example using a `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    # This is a code block
    print(i)
    print("Hello")
# This is outside the code block
print("Done")
```

In this example, everything indented under `for i in range(5):` is part of a code block. It's like following a recipe: first, we print numbers, then we say "Hello" a few times. The last `print("Done")` is outside the code block, so it runs separately.
