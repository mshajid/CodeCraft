# How to Install Python on Windows

As we went through what and why. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through two methods to install Python on your Windows computer: using the official Python installer and installing it from the Microsoft Store.

## Method A: Installing Python from Official Website

### Step 1: Download Python

1. **Visit Python's Official Website**: Open your web browser and go to the official Python website by clicking [**here**](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Choose Python 3.x.x (Latest Version)**: On the Python downloads page, you'll find two versions - Python 3.x.x (latest) and Python 2.x (deprecated). We strongly recommend Python 3.x.x for its features, support, and ongoing updates. Click the "Download Python 3.x.x" button.

   **The '3.x.x' in Python 3.x.x represents the specific version number, which can vary over time as Python is updated. For example, it might be '3.9.7' or '3.11.5.' This notation allows you to download the latest available version of Python 3 while disregarding the exact minor and patch version numbers, as they are subject to change with updates.**

   **Note for Beginners**: If you're a beginner, we recommend downloading the latest version from the download page's top section instead of installing any older version. This tutorial will get updated with each major version release, ensuring you have access to the latest information and features.

3. **Select the Installer**: Scroll down the page to find various installation files for different versions and architectures. Most users should choose the 64-bit version. Click on the "Windows installer (64-bit)" link. If you specifically need the 32-bit version, select "Windows installer (32-bit)" instead.

### Step 2: Install Python

4. **Run the Installer**: Once the Python installer is downloaded, locate the installer file in your Downloads folder or the location where you saved it. Double-click the installer file to run it.

5. **Customize Installation (Optional)**: The installer will open a setup window. You have the option to customize the installation by clicking the "Customize installation" button. This allows you to select optional features and customize the installation path. For most users, the default settings are suitable, so you can click "Next" to proceed.

6. **Add Python to PATH (Recommended)**: On the installation window, check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" (where X.X is the Python version number). This option is recommended as it makes it easier to run Python from the command line. Click "Install" to begin the installation.

7. **Installation in Progress**: The installer will start installing Python. You will see a progress bar indicating the installation status.

8. **Installation Complete**: Once the installation is complete, you will see a screen that says "Setup was successful." Congratulations, Python is now installed on your computer!

9. **Verify Python Installation**: To ensure that Python was installed correctly, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:

    ```
    python --version
    ```

    Output on Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal:
    Python 3.x.x

    If the output is similar to this, then congratulations! You've successfully installed Python on your Windows computer using the official installer.

## Method B: Installing Python from Microsoft Store

### Step 1: Open Microsoft Store

1. **Launch Microsoft Store**: Press the Windows key on your keyboard or click on the Windows icon in the taskbar to open the Start menu. Type "Microsoft Store" in the search bar and press Enter to launch the Microsoft Store app.

### Step 2: Search for Python

2. **Search for Python**: In the Microsoft Store, use the search bar in the top-right corner and type "Python." Press Enter or click on the search icon.

3. **Select Python**: From the search results, you should see an app named "Python." Click on it to open the Python app page.

### Step 3: Install Python

4. **Install Python**: On the Python app page, you will see an "Install" button. Click on it to begin the installation process.

5. **Installation in Progress**: Microsoft Store will download and install Python on your computer. You will see a progress bar indicating the installation status.

6. **Installation Complete**: Once the installation is complete, you will receive a notification that Python has been successfully installed.

### Step 4: Verify Python Installation

7. **Verify Python Installation**: To ensure that Python was installed correctly, you can open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:

    ```
    python --version
    ```

    If the Python version is displayed, such as "Python 3.x.x," then Python has been successfully installed from the Microsoft Store.

Congratulations! You have now installed Python on your Windows computer using the Microsoft Store. You are ready to start using Python for your programming projects.
