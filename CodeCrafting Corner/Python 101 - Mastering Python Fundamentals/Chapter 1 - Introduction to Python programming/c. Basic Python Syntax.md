# Writing Code in the Command Line: Script Mode

Before you commence coding in Visual Studio Code or any other text editor you might be using, let's start by writing some lines of code in your terminal or CMD to get started.

   Open the Terminal or CMD on your computer and type the word "`python`":

   Once you do that, your terminal will enter "Python Mode." In essence, when you type the word `python` in your terminal, it invokes the Python interpreter, allowing you to write Python code.

   Before we write some lines of code, let's understand the meaning of the elements in the picture and what those arrows and lines indicate:

   | Color          | Explanation                                                                                                 |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Red Arrow      | This indicates where the user typed the word "Python" to invoke the interpreter.                         |
   | Green Line     | This line shows where to check for the Python version when you invoke this language interpreter. (In my Replit cloud terminal, it may not have the latest version of Python installed as of now; the current latest version is 3.11.5.) |
   | Yellow Arrows  | The three white ">>>" symbols indicate where you need to type the Python prompt. This is where you should write your code. |

   Now, let's type in our first line of code, which is "Hello World," in the terminal.

   In the terminal, type "`print("Hello, World")`." This line of code is quite self-explanatory. To explain it to beginners, we are instructing the interpreter to "Print this line of text in the terminal." After typing this line of code, you can press the Enter key on your keyboard. If everything is correct, it should print out "Hello, World."
